Hello People!

This is Milan! I am a sales guy who hates sales, but I am pretty good at it so I soldier on. Recently I created a .xls file and coded the hell out of some VB.NET and realized sales is shit, apes are meant to build something. So, when my company pulled out of our current market I decided to jump on this opportunity and learn to code. I am currently looking at different bootcamps, so if you know of any great camps, fill me in on what you know, or drop some knowledge so I can pick it up and get better at this.
